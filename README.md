# Advent of Code

Twenty five days of awesome coding puzzles:
http://adventofcode.com/2015/

Each day's problem description can be found at `problems/day_<n>.md`.
The code and corresponding unit tests can be found at
`{src,test}/advent/day_<n>.clj`.  The puzzle data (if any) is in
`resources/day_<n>.txt`. Noticing a pattern here? :)
